2.9.0

Added TALENTS!

Pressing *J* opens the talent tree. You can pick 4 locations to start with, which determine your speciality.
I call them mage, thief, guardian and warrior.

The tree is huge and every start point branches to the other. Although you need to spend some points to traverse it.

Mages specialize in mana, spell dmg and magic shield.
Thiefs in dodge, energy and penetration.
Guardians in hp and defenses.
Warrior in phys dmg and crits.

To go along the big talent update, i added a few cool trait stats. Stuff like blood mage, which transforms your mana bar into a blood bar and such.


updated to latest forge and curios. v40 and v1.02

updated many stats to have icons for stat gui and talents gui.
added ondmgevent
added ele wep dmg stat.
some optimizations
dodge transformed into dodge rating. now scales to lvl
added magic shield stat
mana and mana regen now scales to lvl. This is in preparation for cool stuff like "your mana takes dmg instead of your hp"
mana and energy costs now scale to average worn gear lvl, not item/spell lvl. This might sound weird but otherwise you could spam your lvl 1 spell that uses % of your spell dmg and never run out of mana.
this was i think the best of the 3 options i had.
Scaling costs to player lvl would make players with low lvl gear suffer a bunch.
Scaling to weapon lvl, would allow cheese builds like % spell to attack dmg rings and lvl 1 weapons.
Scaling to avg gear lvl though, neither of these are a problem anymore. You're still rewarded for increasing gear lvl.
But the only downside is if you say replace a mythic lvl 5 piece with a common lvl 10 piece, you would be punished a bit. But that encourages getting good rarity gear instead of just latest gear for your lvl, 
so maybe it's not a downside at all? Will see!

good news is this is another stat that scales to lvl, meaning finding new higher lvl gear will be much more rewarding!
made mobs a tiny bit stronger cus players now have 125 talent points at max lvl.
as talents introduced a lot more stats, stat requirements now scale harder a bit
runes now have magic shield and dodge as chance for their stats
added 2 new runewords for magic shield users
alchemy single use potions now give 3 pots per craft instead of 1
energy now scales to lvl like mana

Warning though, i bet there will be bugs, and balance problems.
There will also be a lack of mage related unique items and affixes. Which i intend to fill in soon.
