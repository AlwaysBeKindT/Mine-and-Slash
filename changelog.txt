2.8.0

Added armor types! Cloth, Leather, Plate! 

All old items will be plate. Still not sure what to do as their ID is "chest" instead of "plate_chest", might fix it with a breaking change when an expansion happens or 1.15 port.

some perf improvements
weapon tooltips are now less informative by default, but shift shows all the previously available info
gear tooltips now remove empty lines if there's more than 33 lines.
gear no longer break, they remain at 1 durability (but i cant assure you that so try not to keep them at 1 dura)
gears now don't add stats if they have only 1 or 2 durability. This is a fix for mods that prevent items from being broken and keep them at 1 durability.
They should be now useless as they are supposed to.
added on stat calculation event. You can use this to add stats from your own sources, or remove them lol
added collect gear event. This should allow a bit more addon support. 
core stats like dexterity now scale a lot slower. (code rewrite, bugs possible)
fixed player base stats scale value applying to lvl 1 value
sped up modify station a bit
