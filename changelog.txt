3.1.0
THIS UPDATE WILL BREAK SOME EXISTING ITEMS FROM OLDER SAVES. 
This is not something i do lightly, but with me starting to turn my stuff into datapacks, it's something i would have to do sooner or later. 
Better now than after people already make datapacks.

So bad news first:
* converted all my registry ids to same rules minecraft uses, which means no spaces and all lowercase., this might break some stats on old items, sorry! 
For example Physical Damage had id of "damage_flat" but the actual stat is called "physical_damage". So if you wanted to add the stat, you'd use "physical_damage_flat" but it wouldn't work.
Now it should work fine as long as you know the correct stat name and prefix/suffix combos. You can do high_physical_damage_flat, low_physical_damage_flat etc.
The bad news for users is that a lot of items will either break, like plate armors. Or have invalid affixes/chaos stats/primary stats etc. I suggest a new world.
I added a temporary system that auto formats all old names to this standard, but it's not perfect and some might not work. Ignore errors about unknown registries.
Now the good news:
* This is in preparation to allow the mod to be more configurable with datapacks. And as that requires things to be intuitive.. I had to rename a lot of things. 
* runes, runewords, affixes, sets and unique gears are now fully moddable with datapacks! This might have some issues so i'll need some guniea pigs to test it! 
I tested it myself on client and server but it's not foolproof.
* changed compatible items into datapacks. If you're worried you lose your old progress, there's a command that outputs them into new format: "/slash old convert compatible_items".
Also there's a similar method convertToNewFormat for mod devs that use code. But i strongly suggest they switch to datapacks too. If you need help switching, call me on discord.
It's not really that hard, as the object has a .toJson() method, and that's most of the hard work.

* added recipe for increase map tier item in tinkering station
* most loot crate rewards now cant drop common rarity
* fix loot crates without nbt crashing game
* added map events, for now i added a few simple horde spawn events, these events have a chance to happen every minute in maps
* added divine shield cleric spell
* added poisoned weapons druid spell
* added synergies: blizzard, thunder dash, poisoned weapons
* added a whole new ranger skill tree with its own synergies!
* added new unique items
* disabled my workaround that allowed dimension deletition because it caused server crashes. But now dimensions won't be deleted until forge accepts a PR
* decreased item requirements a bit
* fix runewords
* only 1 unique rune per runed item is now allowed
* fix some heals not working
* reduced boss hp, increased xp and loot
* fixed shield textures
* trying out a new system to balance map drops. Bascically i don't want people spamming them all the time, but i don't want people spending hours insta killing overworld mobs for them either.
So i made a system that buffs drops if you're outside a map dimension, but nerfs them if you're inside. This should make maps a lot more precious and time gated, and allow for people to do
other minecraft things in the meantime.
* increased loot droprates in maps a bit.
* grouped all my commands under /slash
This should make using commands a lot easier
* added simple party system, untested. /slash party. For now it should disable friendly fire

3.0.10
* buffed rarity drops default config (needs config reset)
* loot crates now dont spawn with low rarities
* added map info overlay. very simple percentages but should be enough.

3.0.9
* salvage station now stops working if there isn't at least 1 empty output slot
* fix regen not working if it's less than 1
* added a new crate type
* fixed mobs only spawning as epic or rare
* rarity kill requirements now scale exactly to configured rarity weight. So increasing mythic mob spawns in config will increase quest requirements for them too.

3.0.8
* fix group members having different quest requirement numbers
* map worlds now have no level restriction for legendary and mythic mobs
* altered quest time to scale with requirements
* quest req now scale with map tier
* map spawners now have chance to be random mob in maps, be careful!
* map death minute punishment now scales with map tier
* fixed stat bug that didnt allow them to go into minus. this will make maps a lot harder!
* fixed infinite map ticket bug
* fix map reward crate give method.

3.0.7
* attempting to fix teleport bugs
* fix elemental affinity crash
* added giveallstatstesting command
* fix quest completition being ints and not floats

3.0.6
* should fix map quest error

3.0.5
* map quests are now shared completition correctly
* removed torch active effect
* added 2 new synergies
* added achievements for mob rarity kills and boss kills
* updated chinese translations by mcfensi

3.0.4
* fix spell/talent screens for super HD mega large monitors 
* fix weapon durability not being affected by rarity, fixes swords having lower dura too
3.0.3
* various spell buffs
* fix lvl up msg

3.0.2
* fixed wands doing double dmg on right click
* changed lvl up message
* changed default spell hotbar swap key to R
* runes and runed gear now dont drop bellow lvl 8.

3.0.0

[THIS UPDATE IS BETA, EXPECT BUGS!]

REVAMPED SPELL SYSTEM!

Spells are no longer items, you now learn them as you level up!
They are separated currently into 5 classes and you can pick one or all, but you won't have enough points to take all the spells. 
So you have to specialize. But my intent is to make dual or even triple classing a viable thing. 

Now here's the first few classes:

* SHAMAN - thunder
* EMBER MAGE - fire
* OCEAN MYSTIC - water
* DRUID - nature
* CLERIC - heal/buff class that uses all elements.

Shamans can throw tridents of lightning or summon thunderstorms.
Ember Mages can set their foes on fire and deal massive lasting damage.
Ocean Mystics use power of water and ice to deal damage and even sometimes heal.
Druids use nature based spells to heal or damage their enemies.
Clerics have the strongest heals but lack attacking methods.

Another thing to note is that all spells now will be UNIQUE. Meaning they will all differ somehow. 
I am completely abandoning my previous approach that every element based spell must have a counterpart for each element.

This means more FUN for you, but also more balancing problems. Which is why i'd prefer if the community points out not only weak spells, but OP ones too.

Each class's gameplay will be based on a thing called SYNERGY. 
You unlock synergies the same way you unlock spells. They power a certain spell to make it do additional, often gameplay changing effects.

For example a synergy can make Frostball consume Shiver stacks to deal extra damage.

Classes also have certain things that make multi classing viable.
For example the Shiver effect from Ocean Mystic's Whirlpool not only reduces water resistance, but fire resistance too.


MAPS NOW HAVE QUESTS!

Map system was overhauled to have objectives and rewards. You now have more agency against RNG by being able to pick which maps to do based on their rewards,
which are listed on the map item. It could reward runes, unique items, currency etc. You can pick what you want!

You need to finish the objectives fast to get good score. Your reward crate's item rewards will depend on your score.

After you're done with the objective, map's drops will be lowered substantially. You've effectively "cleared" the map. 

ADDED BOSSES!

Every hostile mob has a small chance to become a boss. 
"Boss" is considered a rarity. It's a special rarity for mobs.
Bosses drop a lot more loot but they also use strong spells against you!

Currently there 3 different Summoner type bosses. They summon mobs when you bring them down to a certain hp percent.
I have ideas for more bosses too, like a healer type boss that heals nearby hostile mobs. 
Bosses can only spawn in adventure maps.

enchanted/renamed items no longer get auto put in bags. Should stop some annoyances
configs should now sync to client on login
spell damage renamed to spell power. Should make more sense if nature power increases healing, than nature damage increasing healing
loot now drops based on highest damager. So if you do most dmg to mob and it dies to fire, it will still drop loot!
fixed scaling spell dmg not being applied
removed some stats based on old spells which no longer exist. (runewords affected have other stats boosted)
talent and spell trees are now FULLSCREEN!

If you want to play with friends, use group maps! 
Added stat scale configs.
added command to summon bosses
added new traits to talent tree, i'd advise looking at the left of the tree now :p

leather armor now has dodge as primary stat
dodging now has sound effect, allowing you to know how useful it is!
