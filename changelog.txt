1.7.6
- Fixes the default setting for drop only setting.
1.7.5
- Adds configurable options to add stats on only dropped items and if compatible items can be salvaged.
- Added min and max levels configs for compatible items. This replaces itemIsPlayerLevel and itemLevelIfDoesntUsePlayerLevel. You will need to update your configs.
- Made the min levels needed to trigger punishment configurable.
1.7.4
- Made all Weapon energy costs configured per type. (Sword, Axe, Hammer, Staff, and Bow)
- Made the event of giving of Starter Gear to new players configurable. 
- Fixes the Modify texture in the Inventory. 
- Made maps start dropping at level 10 by default, this is still configurable. 
1.7.3
- Removes Axes from all compats. Fixes https://github.com/kreezxil/World-of-Dragons/issues/334
1.7.2
- Fixes the Repair block texture. Not sure why it didn't update before.
1.7.1
- Allows up to 36 dims to be configured. 
- Made all auto compatible items lists I've made configurable on or off. (Look under the Server section of the mmorpg config file)
- Added Tech Reborn and Thermal Foundations auto compatible lists so they gain stats if installed with Mine and Slash.
- Reworked all the stations, no more anvils! (These are for 1.12 only currently, I am open to feed back on the new stations!)
1.7.0
THIS IS A PR BY AZUREZHEN FOR THE 1.12.2 MC VERSION:
I've fixed the portal code a bit for multiplayer. Doesn't spawn you in the earth anymore.
Back-ported your new Salvage and Modify stations. (Fire of the salvage was being too glitchy so I've disabled the fire for now)
Added default compatible for Vanilla (#70), Ice and Fire, and EB Wizardry items. More to come as I get more requests. Vanilla items will always gain stats, the code for Ice and Fire/EB Wizardry will only load if those mods are found.
Fixed the arrows though wall bug. (#72) I've made them normal bows again and require arrows. The infinite arrow thing is honestly broken balance wise.
