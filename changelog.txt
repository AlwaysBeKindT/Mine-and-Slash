2.5.2
fixed possible source of lag
tried to fix crash for some languages on the psi rune item
2.5.1
updated infusion and spell icons by matpac!
fixed log spam of IllegalArgumentException
2.5.0
A bit of balancing, i think some won't like the nerfs but i feel it's needed:
buffed regenerate spell scaling value
buffed bolt spells base dmg a bit, increased their shoot speed
instant heal scaling value nerfed, mana cost increased, base value buffed. Should ensure a lvl 1 heal spell isn't that useful for a lvl 50 character.
normal items now show affixes in name by default but not uniques
map leave pearl now shows your current map info (velox's idea!)
added warning for crafting bags, to empty items inside
fixed the anti cheese mechanic, should work with lava and enviromental dmg correctly now. Also added a barrier icon to note that mob won't drop mine and slash loot if it's been damaged too much by non player dmg sources.
mobs now show their type if you are holding shift. (so you know if a mod's mob is actually a mob, or it's considered an animal or npc (meaning less loot))
transfered some entity configs to the ones in folder. Means now there are default mob configs per type.
