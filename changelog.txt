2.9.0

Added TALENTS!

Pressing *J* opens the talent tree. You can pick 4 locations to start with, which determine your speciality.
I call them mage, thief, guardian and warrior.

The tree is huge and every start point branches to the other. Although you need to spend some points to traverse it.

Mages specialize in mana, spell dmg and magic shield.
Thiefs in dodge, energy and penetration.
Guardians in hp and defenses.
Warrior in phys dmg and crits.

To go along the big talent update, i added a few cool trait stats. Stuff like blood mage, which transforms your mana bar into a blood bar and such.


updated many stats to have icons for stat gui and talents gui.
added ondmgevent
added ele wep dmg stat.
some optimizations
dodge transformed into dodge rating. now scales to lvl
added magic shield stat
mana and mana regen now scales to lvl. This is in preparation for cool stuff like "your mana takes dmg instead of your hp"
mana costs scale based on player lvl, not item/spell lvl. This might sound weird but otherwise you could spam your lvl 1 spell that uses % of your spell dmg and never run out of mana.
good news is this is another stat that scales to lvl, meaning finding new higher lvl gear will be much more rewarding!
made mobs a tiny bit stronger cus players now have 125 talent points at max lvl.
