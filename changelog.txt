3.2.2
* code tweaks, attempting to fix memory error that i'm not even sure is a problem
* torch should now auto equip with shift click like shields
* added strays to dungeon mobs
* some dungeon mobs now spawn with potion effects.
* rarity by default wont be shown on gears, this should reduce tooltip size a bunch
3.2.1
* removed the hacky thing to stop craft grid repair cus it caused server issues
3.2.0
* Added a config to enable automatic compatible item system. This is very experimental and i have no idea how accurate it is, but here's how it works.
I determine a power level of the item and then separate it into one of the categories: trash, normal and best.
Trash are low level gear that can't go above rare.
Normal can go up to nearly max level and can be legendary.
Best can go up to max level and be mythic.

Most items should fall in the normal category.
This setting is recommended for those who care less about balance, and are more irked about other mod's items not getting my mod's stats.
Even though i tried to balance it as good as i can, it will probably not work ALL the time.

In that case, you can always setup compatible item datapacks for those edge cases,
because this automatic system will only activate for the item if there isn't a datapack already for it.

Power level is determined by how much stats the item has compared to the best item of that category(sword, helmet etc). 
This has some caps to make sure a creative OP weapons with 999999 damage don't screw the median.

So if your sword has say 20 stats while best sword has 100. The power will be 0.2 and fall in "trash" category. 
If it had 30 or more, it would get the "normal" category.
If it had 80 or more , it would get the "best" category.

* added magic steal stat
* used a hacky way to replace vanilla craft grid repair, now it shouldn't work on any items with my mod's stats.
