2.8.0

Added armor types! Cloth, Leather, Plate! 

All old items will be plate. Still not sure what to do as their ID is "chest" instead of "plate_chest", might fix it with a breaking change when an expansion happens or 1.15 port.



gears now don't add stats if they have only 1 or 2 durability. This is a fix for mods that prevent items from being broken and keep them at 1 durability.
They should be now useless as they are supposed to.
added on stat calculation event. You can use this to add stats from your own sources, or remove them lol
added collect gear event. This should allow a bit more addon support. 
core stats like dexterity now scale a lot slower. (code rewrite, bugs possible)
fixed player base stats scale value applying to lvl 1 value
sped up modify station a bit
2.7.4
try fix server crash on profession block loading client side class
2.7.3
* if repair only in station is set true in config, mod's items won't be able to be combined in craft, repaired in anvil or in other vanilla blocks. 
This is a fix to items being combinable in craft grid, but is probably it'll stop repair from other mods too. Either way it suits the config name.
updated to forge 28.1.10
added xp penalty on death (configurable)
buffed regenerate to heal twice as fast. This is a 100% buff, i'll probably have to nerf it a bit
jewerly can now be enchanted with unbreaking

attempting performance improvements
updated to forge 28.1.6

added curios min version requirement. not sure if works
added max instability config and increased default value to 500 from 250
2.7.0

ADDED PROFESSIONS!

Professions are basically a way to craft things, but gated by your profession level. Max lvl of recipes is 100, but max profession lvl is 1000. Each lvl gives tiny bonus chance to
lower material cost and increase output amount.
Currently i added Alchemy and Tinkering.
- Alchemy is used to create potions, both instant and buffs, to help you restore mana etc. It also contains special potions like one that teleports you to your bed.
- Tinkering is a profession used to create currencies. 

Start using them by creating Alchemy and Tinkering Stations.

Profession stations can only be used by 1 person each. You occupy it forever when you place it. This is because of the level system limitations.
As a bonus though, if you lose your profession levels (they are attached to your player data) you can recover them by opening the profession block because they are stored there too.
Of course the level is whatever lvl you were at the last time you used the station.

I think professions will be really cool because they work like villager trading, so no need to remember craft grid order of materials or use JEI. I'll just have to balance them correctly.
I also want to add some more interesting features to them, but don't have ideas currently.
