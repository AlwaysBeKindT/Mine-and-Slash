2.7.3
* if repair only in station is set true in config, mod's items won't be able to be combined in craft, repaired in anvil or in other vanilla blocks. 
This is a fix to items being combinable in craft grid, but is probably it'll stop repair from other mods too. Either way it suits the config name.

ADDED PROFESSIONS!

Professions are basically a way to craft things, but gated by your profession level. Max lvl of recipes is 100, but max profession lvl is 1000. Each lvl gives tiny bonus chance to
lower material cost and increase output amount.
Currently i added Alchemy and Tinkering.
- Alchemy is used to create potions, both instant and buffs, to help you restore mana etc. It also contains special potions like one that teleports you to your bed.
- Tinkering is a profession used to create currencies. 

Start using them by creating Alchemy and Tinkering Stations.

Profession stations can only be used by 1 person each. You occupy it forever when you place it. This is because of the level system limitations.
As a bonus though, if you lose your profession levels (they are attached to your player data) you can recover them by opening the profession block because they are stored there too.
Of course the level is whatever lvl you were at the last time you used the station.

I think professions will be really cool because they work like villager trading, so no need to remember craft grid order of materials or use JEI. I'll just have to balance them correctly.
I also want to add some more interesting features to them, but don't have ideas currently.
