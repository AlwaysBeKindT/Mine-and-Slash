3.6.0

SPELL REWORK! (UNFINISHED)
* spells and synergies now have levels
* synergies now cost mana
* removed some spells as i consider them bad (like geyser) and others because their spell school doesn't have enough spells, they'll probably be re-added later
* added some new spells
* spell damage stats are now percents and increase spell damage by percent, instead of adding to the damage.
* infusion reworked
* added cooldown reduction stat

Other:
* bosses now spawn less minions but they're all max rarity
* blocking fully now stops attack knockbacks. can't figure out how to stop the attack sounds though
* made vanilla teams usable for exp and friendly fire off.
* casting spells now slows you down
* server performance improvements
* added all the buildathon rewards that people asked for (still many didn't come claim them though)
* fixed unique cangetset field not doing anything
