3.4.3
* added bestiary (you'll see it in your main hub anyway)
* added experimental way that makes thrown weapons work.
 (mod devs literally just have to set player as the true damage source and have the itemstack saved somewhere in either the class fields, nbt or datamanager.)
* better item names on ground, now also works for all items with stats
* reduced log spam
* item names only render when close now, woops.
* uniques no longer have affixes but their unique stats are now increased
* removed conditional chaos stats (on low crit..etc , boring)

3.4.2
* creative players can now destroy dungeon blocks and place them.
* should fix mending wasting lvls if cant be repaired
* repair station should accept fuels now with hoppers by side
* now by default renders loot item names on ground
* added a recipe to break down ores
* ore/fuel ratio should have no loss now

3.4.1
* fix unique compatible items
* fix mob damage level scaling being wrong.
* implemented attack cooldown. Unsure if perfect. But at least i know it reduces damage based on the attack speed.
* made attacks with 90%> attack cooldown get refunded energy and mana costs. So if you attack at 95%, you only use 95% energy.
But if you attack with 20% attack cooldown, you use more energy. (up to change) Intended to encourage healthy clicking and some timing.
* tuned up stat scaling (config)
* hammers now only aoe when atk cooldown is refreshed enough
* hammers do double damage if attacking only 1 target at refreshed cooldown. They should be good as main weapon now
* reduced max default player lvl to 60
* tweaked xp formula
* reduced boss xp 
* added nether dungeon theme

3.4.0

* removed mythic rarity, epics are now purple, rares are now blue. Higher rarities are now much better than lower ones
* removed alchemy station, professions are a failed system. 
* higher rarities now have more secondary stats
* made mobs stronger at higher levels. 
* removed item rarity configs, now they are configurable as datapacks (still unsure if they should be configs or datapacks but for now they can be datapacks..)
* removed wands
* fixed item dupe with bags with right clicking on offhand
* removed infusion stats and the 6 items associated with them. I feel the system is kinda lame. It was basically just a power upgrade
* reduced currency drops as a result
* reduced player base stats (clear base stats config to notice)
* armor is no longer given for free as a base stat. This means mages should rely less on it. No more free 20% armor!
* reduced hunger default cost a bit (config)
* made jewerly rarer
* made wisdom the mage defense stat while int is the offense stat
* increased ore spawns
I feel this is a problem caused by addition of skill, spell and talent points, player gets increasingly stronger so game gets easier the higher level you are..
You can also get stronger affixes, sets etc at high lvls. Gonna start with a 50% strength multiplier to lvl 100 mobs.
* added more dev commands. 
If you're in a dungeon and the room looks wrong (like entrance being blocked) or the there's a whole chunk missing,
 Do: /slash dev log dungeon_room when you're inside it.
And send me the log. The command should tell me what room is faulty.
* nerfed stone of corruption, now increases gear lvl by 2 and has 20% more break chance
* overlays shouldnt render in spectator mode anymore
* nerfed wis and int a bit
* dungeons are now filled with obsidian if theres no room there. So less problems with mobs escaping into void.
* reduced spell dmg gotten from stats
* buffed arrow barrage and arrow storm
* buffed higher rarity mob dmg a bit
* reduced default stat scaling
* elemental resist no longer reduces physical damage (... i found the balance problem)
* elemental resist no longer reduces ele dmg after normal resists..
In short, players with elemental resists should lose their immortality this patch.
* fix shields blocking full amount always
* items can now be modified even at max instability. But only if the config for breaking modified items is enabled.
Basically, if you enable breaking, you can modify as much as you like as long as it doesn't break, but 
if you disable breaking, the instability limit will act as the cap instead of the break chance.
* should fix too much hunger spending, maybe it'd still be too high
* unique gear now always has affixes and has a higher lower limit on stats.


3.3.6
* fix crash in map

3.3.5
* updated to newest forge
* adjusted capacitor recipes
* mobs in dungeons can now open wooden doors to haunt player, this doesnt seem to work all the time unfortunately but should add some more danger. 
* added a trapped chest for dungeons 
* added more structure block processors to accomodate some builds from the build-a-thon
* added config for auto compatible items to be salvagable
* made mobs in maps not take dmg from being stuck in wall, also they get knocked back around until they get unstuck now!
* made my dungeon gen code a bit neater. Now i can make it so certain dungeon themes can only have certain other dungeon themes!
Like i can set it so a snowy theme can't spawn together with a nether theme. This wasn't a problem when i only had stone brick and sandstone themes, but now it is.

Build-a-thon results:
* Added whole new dungeon themes you'll see often: icy spruce mansion, nature, mossy brick and mineshaft.
* Added some other dungeon themes that will be rare because there aren't enough rooms: 	tent, brick, steampunk.
* Added some dungeon rooms of existing types and some misc ones.

The leaderboard rankings and rewards will be coming soonish when i discuss things with dreckz.

* can see lvl and exp in main hub now

3.3.2
* fix too high map dmg affix
3.3.1
* increased map startup cost.
* when you sleep you now get a message you're refreshed, meaning map droprate is high for you now.
* added a teleport back scroll, its craftable
* changed mob dmg from spell to atk dmg to attack element dmg in maps.
* fixed salvage outputs being stuck and not put into hoppers
* repair station is now automatable too
* fixed control not showing enchants
* added vanilla like gui option that doesnt show numbers for hp energy etc and neither lvl or exp, but it looks nicer to me.
* should fix crash on random

3.3.0

This is basically an economy update! I added new resource sinks, increased repair costs, reduced salvaged ores etc..
I also added a new way to gain ores, salvaging currencies! 
I'm trying to make it so there's no such thing as a useless item, and currencies before were useless if you didn't need them.
Map device now needs fuel to start maps (why was dimensional travel free before!?) and now you can find a dungeon merchant in dungeons to spend your extra ores on.
Oh and lots of items now need to be identified to be used. 
In short, prepare for scarcity!

The good thing is even if you hate the scarcity, i added some configs to let you control the costs of these resource sinks.

* try fix lightning strikes being heard from everyone on server
* confine random dungeons to world border as some mods might change it
* regen should now cost hunger same as vanilla regen did before
* health and magic shield no longer regen at low hunger.
* gear and runes now salvage for ore 1 rarity bellow, capped at common at the bottom.
* altered rarity drops
* fixed loot crates in maps having too high chance to drop maps.
* altered repair station fuel per ore rarity to be more in line with the actual craft value of the ores.
* casting spells now damages weapon
* reduced loot drops default config (needs server config clear)
* some currencies are now salvagable. (ones with crafting recipes) This should help balance economy a bit.
* updated chinese lang
* removed tinkering station. Added most currencies back as recipes. (i really thought the tinkering station would be more fun.. IT'S NOT. So it's gone)
* unified naming of reset potions and now they're craftable instead of needing alchemy station
* map device now needs fuel same as repair station to activate maps.
* added identify tome
* items of higher rarities now have chance to be unidentified and need an identify tome to reveal it.
* vanilla hp now factors into mob xp gained
* added a trader npc
* added a dungeon room that has the trader npc
* added identify tomes and some food to dungeon chests

Please tell me how the new changes feel.
The goal is for normal play (without using mob farmers or automated ore farming) for resources to be scarce. 
If i succeeded you're probably asking yourself whether to spend your ores buying gear from the merchant or crafting currencies. 
You should also feel like completing the whole dungeon and taking everything from chests.

If you feel lazy taking items from dungeon chests, feel the merchant prices are too cheap etc, then i probably failed.
It's also possible i made it too hard and you won't have ores to repair gear.. Will see!
